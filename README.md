### 👩‍💻 A little about me

I’m a **Computer Science undergraduate** who likes understanding *how things work* by actually writing code, breaking it, and fixing it again.

Most days, you’ll find me:
- practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms in C++**
- using **Python** for small scripts and experiments  
- working inside a **Linux (Arch Linux)** environment  
- pushing code to GitHub and slowly getting better at it  

I don’t know everything — but I enjoy learning something new every day.

### 🧠 What I’m learning right now

- 📌 Problem-solving and DSA (C++)
- 📌 Writing cleaner and more readable code
- 📌 Basic web development concepts
- 📌 Using tools that make development easier

### 🌱 My mindset

- learning over perfection
