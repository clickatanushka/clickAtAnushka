Hi, I’m Anushka 👋
I’m a Computer Science undergraduate who’s still figuring things out and learning by building.

I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood, especially around Linux, operating systems, and low-level programming, but I also explore other areas like data analysis and machine learning when something feels interesting or useful.

This GitHub is mostly a learning space:
experiments
coursework
side projects
things I break and then fix

Some repositories are polished, many are not — and that’s intentional. I care more about learning deeply than making everything look perfect.

Right now, I’m focusing on:
getting better at problem-solving and DSA
becoming comfortable with Linux and system-level concepts
building small projects that teach me something new
I’m open to learning, feedback, and growing over time.

Thanks for stopping by 🌱
