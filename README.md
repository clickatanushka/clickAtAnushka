### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Computer Science undergraduate** who enjoys learning by building things, breaking them, and figuring out how to make them better.

Currently:
- practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms in C++**
- writing small scripts and projects in **Python**
- working in a **Linux (Arch Linux)** environment  
- exploring tools that help turn data and ideas into insights  

I don’t aim for perfection — I aim for progress.  
**Always open to positive criticism and feedback.**
